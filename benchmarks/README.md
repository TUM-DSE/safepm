## SafePM benchmarks

This directory contains the benchmark drivers and the respective scripts to run them.
For more information on how to run each benchmark, please see each folder's specific README.

The automated scripts generate the appropriate images with the software dependencies and run the benchmarks inside containers.

The results for each benchmark are stored in a created directory inside the respective benchmark folder (does not apply for the `bugs` benchmark that prints the errors in the `standard output`)
