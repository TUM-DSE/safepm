Scripts used for creating the plots in the paper.

`import_pmembench_map.sh`: Imports the results of the pmembench_map benchmark. Supply as the only command line argument the path to the results folder as generated by the benchmark script. The imported results can be processed into charts using the command `python3 generate_plots.py plot_config_maps.yml`
`import_pmemkv.sh`: The same, but for the pmemkv benchmark. To process the imported results into charts, use the command `python3 generate_plots.py plot_config_pmemkv.yml`
